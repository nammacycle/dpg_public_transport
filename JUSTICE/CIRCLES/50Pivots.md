Chapter 1: Multi-Scalar and Multi-Polar Injustice
Injustice in mobility is multi-dimensional, operating across various scales and affecting multiple social, environmental, and economic spheres. Here, we explore the systemic injustices caused by the automobile-centric approach to mobility, identifying 25 pivotal points of injustice.

1. Energy Consumption Disparity
Cars consume significantly more energy than bicycles or public transport per capita. This disparity leads to a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, disproportionately benefiting wealthier individuals who own cars while increasing energy costs for the entire society.

2. Carbon Emissions
The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions. This unjustly affects developing nations that are more vulnerable to climate change, despite contributing less historically to global emissions.

3. Air Pollution Inequity
Urban air pollution from car exhaust disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, who often live closer to highways or industrial zones.

4. Road Infrastructure Investment Bias
Public funds are disproportionately spent on building and maintaining highways, roads, and parking facilities for cars, often at the expense of investing in public transport and cycling infrastructure.

5. Land Use and Urban Sprawl
Car-centric cities encourage urban sprawl, leading to inefficient land use. Marginalized groups are often pushed to the outskirts of cities, forcing them to endure long, expensive commutes, further isolating them from job opportunities and essential services.

6. Public Space Encroachment
Automobile infrastructure consumes vast amounts of public space, reducing opportunities for social interaction, parks, and community spaces. Those who do not own cars are excluded from enjoying these shared resources.

7. Financial Burden on Non-Car Owners
Public resources are diverted towards car infrastructure and subsidies for fuel, which do not benefit people who cannot afford cars. The poorest citizens end up subsidizing infrastructure that serves the wealthiest.

8. Traffic Accidents and Road Safety
Car-dominant systems expose vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists—to higher risks of traffic accidents. These accidents disproportionately impact children, the elderly, and low-income populations who are more likely to walk or cycle.

9. Health Inequities
Air pollution, traffic accidents, and the sedentary lifestyle encouraged by car use contribute to public health crises such as respiratory diseases, obesity, and cardiovascular issues, disproportionately affecting the poor.

10. Accessibility and Mobility Gaps
Car ownership becomes a necessity in cities that lack reliable public transport, exacerbating mobility gaps for those who cannot afford private vehicles, especially women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.

11. Social Segregation
Automobile-centric cities reinforce social segregation by isolating wealthy, car-owning residents in well-connected suburbs while poorer populations are relegated to under-served areas with limited transportation options.

12. Economic Disadvantage for the Poor
Low-income workers often spend a disproportionately large part of their income on transportation, whether through long commutes, high fares, or car ownership, leaving less for other essential expenses like housing and healthcare.

13. Climate Vulnerability
The contribution of automobile emissions to climate change worsens the conditions for climate-vulnerable populations, especially those in low-lying coastal regions and agrarian communities that are already experiencing climate-related disasters.

14. Gender Disparity in Mobility
Women, particularly in developing countries, often face higher barriers to mobility due to safety concerns, inadequate public transport, and a lack of cycling infrastructure. Their access to jobs, education, and healthcare is thus limited.

15. Injustice in Traffic Congestion
Traffic congestion primarily caused by private vehicles disproportionately impacts those who rely on public buses, which are slower and less reliable in congested conditions, further entrenching inequality.

16. Inadequate Public Transport
A lack of investment in high-quality, reliable public transport disproportionately affects low-income populations, women, and students who depend on buses and trains for commuting.

17. Fuel Subsidies and Environmental Damage

18. Displacement for Highway Projects
Building highways often involves displacing entire communities, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups like slum dwellers, Indigenous populations, and low-income families.

19. Noise Pollution and Mental Health
Car-dominated urban areas produce high levels of noise pollution, which is linked to mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Poor communities living near major roads suffer more from these impacts.

20. Heat Island Effect
The concentration of vehicles, asphalt, and concrete in urban areas contributes to the heat island effect, raising local temperatures. This impacts the health and well-being of urban residents, particularly those in lower-income neighborhoods without access to air conditioning.

21. Road Pricing and Toll Inequity
Road tolls and congestion pricing systems often disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on driving for work or access to remote areas, while wealthier individuals can easily afford these charges.

22. Marginalization of Non-Motorized Transport Users
Pedestrians and cyclists are often marginalized in city planning, facing unsafe conditions, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of legal protections, further discouraging sustainable forms of transport.

23. Car Dependence and Social Isolation
Car dependency promotes social isolation by reducing opportunities for spontaneous interactions in public spaces. Those who walk or use public transport are excluded from such mobility networks, reinforcing social divides.

24. Economic Opportunity Loss
By prioritizing automobile infrastructure, governments miss out on the economic benefits of a cycling economy, which can create jobs, reduce healthcare costs, and boost local commerce.

25. Psychological Burden of Inaccessible Cities
For people without access to cars, cities designed around automobiles create psychological stress and a sense of exclusion. The daily struggle to access jobs, education, and services fosters a deep sense of injustice.

Conclusion
These 25 pivotal points reveal that the injustice embedded in automobile-focused mobility operates across multiple scales and poles of society. It affects the environment, economy, social dynamics, and the well-being of marginalized populations. Recognizing these scales of injustice allows us to advocate for systemic changes, such as prioritizing active and public transport, to create a more just and equitable mobility landscape.
