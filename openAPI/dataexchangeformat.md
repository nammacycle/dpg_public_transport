data exchange formats

As explained in the portal of standards for public transport offer data, a NeTex format file is an XML file. This set of xml files, which we will call “profile“, will define the whole network: stops, lines, timetables, fares, etc. Each European country defines the way it wants to exchange these XML files. France has defined 5 NeTex profiles:

The “Stops” profile, which is the exchange profile for the description of public transport stops.
The “Networks” profile, which presents the topology of public transport networks.
The “Schedules” profile, which is an exchange profile for the description of public transport schedules.
“Accessibility”, is an exchange profile for the description of the accessibility of public transport networks.
The “Fares” profile covers fare information, including complex fare models.
